    - Currently to use this program you need to clone the repo, create a python virtual environment, install the required [Python packages](/Documentation/requirements.txt), navigate in command line (with the virtual environment active) to where <code>Main.py</code> is [located](/5_axis_thorlabs_prior_stage/) under <code>5_axis_thorlabs_prior_stage</code> folder, and run <code>python Main.py</code>. This should run the program. **NOTE: To run the program without it throwing an error, you must have all stages and components plugged into the computer and turned on.**
